# RssFeedReaderSchoolProject
Worked in a SCRUM team of four students at WSU. I was the leader of software design and implementation.

The interface allows the user to view and organize RSSfeeds in a tree structure. The tree can be saved and loaded in an .xml file. It also allows the user to filter 
articles by title and location.
